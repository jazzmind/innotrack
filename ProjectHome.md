The Innotrack platform was designed to support a unique innovation learning environment where university students and corporations collaborate to innovate. This concept was developed by Deloitte Australia and piloted by RMIT and USyd.

The software here is an early prototype developed by the YourSoftware group at RMIT and Deloitte's Innovation program.

Deloitte is committed to helping make Australia more innovative, which is why this project is being made Open Source. We hope others will help us enhance this platform so that we can continue to educate new generations of innovators.
